# Skip Demo Output

This repository contains HTML output examples generated by [Skip AI](https://www.askskip.ai), a platform that leverages multiple large language models to create interactive web components and visualizations.

## Overview

Skip AI used a combination of AI models to generate the HTML code in this repository:
- Groq and Deepseek-Llama3.3 Distill for various sections
- OpenAI's GPT-4.1 for the main code writing

The demos showcase Skip AI's ability to create interactive, functional web components from natural language prompts.

## Demo Examples

### [CRM Data Explorer](./demo_1.html)

A fully interactive CRM data explorer interface that demonstrates:
- Tab-based navigation between different entity types (Accounts, Contacts, Activities)
- Sortable and filterable data tables
- Detail views with related records
- Foreign key navigation between related entities

**Technical features:**
- Custom CSS with responsive design
- Font Awesome integration for icons
- Lodash for data manipulation
- Client-side state management
- Relationship handling between data entities

## How It Works

Skip AI analyzes user prompts to understand the desired functionality, then generates complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that can be integrated into web applications. The demo output in this repository represents raw HTML components that:

1. Work standalone without additional dependencies
2. Are fully interactive with client-side data handling
3. Demonstrate complex UI patterns and data relationships
4. Include responsive design considerations

## Future Improvements

Currently, Skip AI generates vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without using modern frameworks. Future plans include: using React to clean up and simplify/shorten the code generated by the AI.
